        <p><b>Discover the story behind CozyCup Café</b></p>
        <p style="font-family:courier;"> Carl De Castro, the founder of Cozy Cup, was deeply inspired by his father's passionate devotion of coffee.  
            Carl grew up watching his father make a cup of coffee every morning, enjoying the comfort it provided as much as the flavor.  
            In 2023, Carl founded Cozy Cup because he wanted to spread that same warmth to others. 
             Cozy Cup swiftly established itself as a gathering spot for friends, family, and students by combining the cozy atmosphere
              of a home with the heady scent of freshly ground beans.  Every cup is a sip of coziness, family, and treasured memories here, not just coffee.</p>
